/**
 * The CI gate, run locally on `git push`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. GitHub Actions was blocked account-wide from 2026-08-09
 * to 2026-08-31 - every run on every repo failed in ~3 seconds ("The job was
 * not started because recent account payments have failed"), before executing
 * a single step. Sixteen repos carried a ci.yml and not one of them ran. This
 * restores the gate on the workstation, at `git push` - the moment work leaves
 * the machine.
 *
 * IT NOW CHECKS INSTEAD OF ASSUMING (2026-09-03). The original printed
 * "GitHub Actions is off (billing)" unconditionally and ran the full gate
 * every time - so once billing was fixed, every push in sixteen repos paid
 * ~4 minutes to redo work Actions was already doing, while the banner said
 * something false. The gate now asks GitHub whether the last CI run went
 * green and steps aside when it did.
 *
 * THE SKIP IS FAIL-SAFE, and that direction is the whole design. It stands
 * down ONLY on a positive, recent green from `gh`. Every uncertainty - no gh,
 * not authenticated, no network, no ci.yml, no runs, a stale last run, a red
 * last run - RUNS the gate. Being wrong about "Actions has this" means
 * shipping unchecked code; being wrong the other way costs four minutes.
 *
 * GREEN IS NOT ENOUGH - CI MUST RUN ON THIS PUSH (2026-09-18). rocketscan's
 * ci.yml dropped its `push` trigger; its last green run was a manual
 * (workflow_dispatch) run on an older commit, and the gate stood down on it,
 * so pushes to main got no check at all until forced by hand. Twelve repos
 * dropped `push` in the CI-minutes pass. The stand-down now needs BOTH:
 *   - the PUSHED commit's ci.yml is triggered by a push to the pushed branch
 *     (`on: push`, a `branches`/`branches-ignore` filter that admits it, no
 *     `paths`/`paths-ignore` filter - the push may touch only ignored paths),
 *     and the branch is known (the hook's remote ref, else HEAD's branch);
 *   - the last `push`-event run of ci.yml ON THAT BRANCH is green (or queued /
 *     in progress) and under 30 days old. Manual, scheduled, PR and other-branch
 *     runs never count.
 * A repo with no push trigger therefore ALWAYS runs the gate - which, since
 * the CI-minutes pass, is most of the fleet, and is the point: there the gate
 * is the only check a push to main gets.
 *
 * IT REMEMBERS WHAT IT ALREADY PROVED (2026-09-13). On 2026-09-12 every CI run
 * in all eleven repos had died on the Actions budget, so the stand-down above
 * never fired, and a one-file Terraform merge into achilles re-ran all twelve
 * steps - 517 seconds - against package trees byte-identical to ones that had
 * passed hours earlier. Budget limits are expected to recur, so the gate can no
 * longer lean on Actions for speed. Three changes:
 *   - A PASS CACHE keyed by the git tree of each step's declared inputs (see
 *     "the pass cache" below). Same inputs, same lockfiles, same gate, same
 *     node: the step is skipped and says so.
 *   - Packages run SIDE BY SIDE when there is memory for it, one step at a time
 *     within a package.
 *   - A heartbeat while a step runs, and per-step timings in the pass marker.
 *
 * GENERATED FILE. Canonical source:
 *   ~/coding/engineering-standards/scripts/templates/check-ci-local.mjs
 * Re-stamp with `engineering-standards/scripts/install-local-ci.sh <repo>`.
 * Per-repo differences belong in `.ci-local.json`, NOT in edits here - eight
 * divergent copies of a gate is the failure the standards repo exists to stop.
 * `check-fleet-parity.mjs` now fails when a copy differs from this file.
 *
 * WHAT IT RUNS. Auto-detected from each package.json: typecheck, lint, test
 * (test:ci / test:coverage / test, first match), build. Blocking, because those
 * are facts about your diff. `audit` is warn-only: it fails on dependency NEWS,
 * and an advisory published overnight blocking a CSS-only push is how a gate
 * earns a reflexive --no-verify.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE. This gate is a SUBSTITUTE for ci.yml, so the dangerous
 * failure is passing while silently covering less than CI did. Guards:
 *   - Missing tooling is UNCHECKED and EXITS NONZERO, never a quiet pass.
 *   - A step killed by a signal (the OOM killer) is UNCHECKED, never a FAIL.
 *   - Every run diffs its own steps against ci.yml's `run:` lines and prints
 *     what it does NOT cover. A green run that skipped half of CI must say so.
 *   - A cached step prints "cached", with when and how long it took - never "pass".
 *
 * .ci-local.json keys:
 *   dirs              package directories (default ["."])
 *   skip              step keys to skip, bare ("test") or per dir ("backend:test")
 *   extraSteps        [{label, cmd, dir?, mode?, inputs?}] - cached only with `inputs`
 *   docsOnlyIgnore    regexes; a push touching only these skips the gate
 *   inputs            {"<dir>" | "<dir>:<key>": [paths]} - what a step READS.
 *                     Default is the whole repo. The step's own dir is always added.
 *   parallel          run package dirs side by side (default: only on a machine
 *                     with 16 GB or more - see "run" below for why)
 *   minFreeMBPerStep  free memory needed to start a step beside another (default 2048)
 *   jestWorkers       workers for a `jest --runInBand` test script run BY THIS GATE
 *                     (default 2 on a machine with 7 GB or more, else 1). The
 *                     script itself is untouched - CI and deploys still run it
 *                     serially. 1 opts a repo out (a suite with a fixed port or a
 *                     shared container). See "two workers" below.
 *
 * Bypass: `git push --no-verify`, or SKIP_LOCAL_CI=1.
 * Force the gate even when Actions is green: LOCAL_CI_FORCE=1.
 * Ignore the pass cache for one run: LOCAL_CI_NO_CACHE=1.

// 🔴 INPUTS DEFAULT TO THE WHOLE REPO, and narrowing them is a claim. Tests in
// this fleet read across package lines as a matter of course: achilles'
// frontend drift tests parse backend/ and terraform/, its backend tests read

// reads frontend/. A per-package default would have served a stale pass for
// every one of them. So the default only reuses a pass when the WHOLE tree is
// identical, and `.ci-local.json` "inputs" narrows it per dir or per step. A
// wrong narrowing is a false pass, so write the evidence beside it.
//
// 🔴 FAIL-SAFE. No key - an input with uncommitted changes, an input path that
// does not exist at HEAD, no HEAD, a push of a commit that is not the checkout,
// LOCAL_CI_NO_CACHE=1 - means the step runs. Only a matching key skips.

// or the network; that is a flaky test, and LOCAL_CI_NO_CACHE=1 is the escape.

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The pass marker: stop paying for this twice (added 2026-09-07)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY. This gate runs at `git push`, and then `deploy.sh` preflight runs the
// SAME typecheck and the SAME suite minutes later. Measured on 2026-09-07
// shipping one change: achilles paid 155s here and ~360s again in preflight -
// 8.5 minutes of testing to ship once. gitgood paid 141s + ~185s. Both repos
// already have a TRUST_CI shortcut that would skip preflight, and it can never
// fire while GitHub Actions is billing-blocked, which it has been since
// 2026-09-04.
//
// So record what passed, and let the deploy read it. `ci-local-verdict.sh` is
// the ONE reader - deploy scripts call that rather than re-implementing this
// check four times, which is the second-copy failure the standards repo exists
// to stop.
//
// 🔴 THE MARKER IS PINNED TO THREE HASHES, NOT A TIMESTAMP. A TTL would be
// theatre: an hour-old marker on identical inputs is exactly as good as a
// fresh one, and a fresh marker on changed inputs is worthless. What actually
// invalidates a result is the inputs changing, so that is what is recorded:
//   - sha   the commit the gate ran against
//   - lock  the lockfiles, so a dependency change re-runs
//   - gate  this script + .ci-local.json, so CHANGING THE GATE re-runs
// The third is the one that is easy to forget and the most dangerous to omit:
// without it, widening the gate would be silently skipped by a marker written
// under the old, narrower definition.
//
// A step served from the pass cache counts as covered: it passed on the same
// inputs, which is the same claim a marker makes about a commit.
//
// 🔴 NO MARKER IS WRITTEN FROM A DIRTY TREE. A result cannot be attributed to
// a commit that does not describe what was tested. `--no-verify` writes nothing
// either, because this code never runs then - which is correct: a bypassed gate
// must not license a skipped preflight.
